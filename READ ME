This is the sales dashboard that I created in Power Bi using a super store sales data.
This dashboard can help the company to understand the stores performance over time and there sales in different areas within US.
This also gives an overview of the important KPIs such as profits, quantity sold, etc and the top performing product categories.
This will help the company to make better business decisions.
